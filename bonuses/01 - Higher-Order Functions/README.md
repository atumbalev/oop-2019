# Bonus 1. Higher-Ordr Functions

## Problem

* Define a struct IntArray that keeps a C array of integers and its size.
* Define a function map that takes an IntArray and a Unary Operation f (takes one int, returns one int) and returns an IntArray where f was applied on each element in the array
* Define a function filter that takes an IntArray and a Predicate (takes an int returns true or false) and returns an IntArray that contains only the elements of the original one that statisfy the predicate
* Demonstrate the usage of these functions using lambdas (see Prison.cpp from exercise 01) (You will also have to write a print funtion for IntArray)
